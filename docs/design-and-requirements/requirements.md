- Provide an embed link for the generated video and a button for the user to copy this link.

- Provide user with an option to download the generated video.

- Reject user input and display appropriate error messages if unsupported file types are detected for text or image uploads.

### **Non-Functional Requirements**

- **Performance** – Portable software and fast generation of animated video.
- **Code Quality** – Code must be professionally formatted, linted and maintained.
- **Robustness** - Handles incorrect/invalid inputs.
- **Efficiency** - Maximum utilization of resources for fastest response times.
- **Accuracy** - Accurate syncing of animated video character to TTS audio.

### **User Requirements**

- Users can view the generated video.

- Users can copy the embed code/link for the generated video.

- Users can download the generated video.

### **Constraints/Risks**

- Inexperience with animation and animation software.
- Time constraints: Limited time to complete the project, students need to focus on other courses every week
- Poor team communication
- Animation quality not meeting client standards.

### **Choice of Tech Stack**

### **Testing Strategies**

- Unit Testing every feature using PyTest.

- CI/CD using GitHub Actions workflows: Running all tests after a Pull Request to the main branch is created to ensure all new changes work with previously implemented features.

- Usability Testing on product prototypes to ensure software is working as intended and to gather target users' impressions on the product.

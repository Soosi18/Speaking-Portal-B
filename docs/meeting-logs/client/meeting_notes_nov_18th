### Talking Points:
Presented demonstration video
Errors for corrupt/incompatible files will be caught on Kukarella's side prior to getting to us
Asked what other groups used for forced alignment
Discussed milestone requirements


### Notes:
Nazim suggested we put in an animator request sometime before winter break
Look further into Rhubarb forced aligner for assistance with phoneme generation for other languages
Discussed next steps, refinement, additional options/movement, avatar/mouth select etc.
Continue to refine code for smoother and more consistent animation

### Talking Points
- presented demo video with new assets
- Nazim mentioned that speed is pretty important for video generating time
- Mentioned that he wanted to see if we could create a good animation with just one model. Code program with support to swap out model and still work (IE hard code)
- No points to mention on demo video, seems good enough. Nazim mentioned he would like to see more poses.

## Main points of todayâ€™s meeting
### Milestones
Have each group discussing their milestones with the clients and check if client get some problems about the milestones.
### Repo visibility
It is fine to leave the repo public and afterwards the developers of Kukarella may need to access to the repo.
### Client Requirements
Clients needs some requirements of the animation in case the group have some questions about the animation after starting code.
### Small Tips from Eric
Double check whether our team have created the Kukarella account if not ask Eric on dc so he can do it later.

# Plans for next week:
- decide approach we will move forward with
- iron out requirements for chosen method
- break down tasks and work on requirements report
- next week consist of choosing what they want to do
- getting situated and getting more in depth requirements 
- easiest way to implement our solution if its in JavaScript because their servers run using NodeJS and Express
- also pretty flexible, could create separate server for other language
- expecting API they can access as the end goal, API can be run on EC2 or Google's/Amazon's Serverless functions.
### with current voice to text are time stamps included? Timestamp are not included. They said they will come back on this 
### nothing concrete, looked into or possible setup
- breaking up audio file has to be done by us, nothing by Kukarella along those line has been attempted
### when it comes to avatars that you want, are there specific ones, do we have access to the assets for the avatars?
 ### absolutely there will be access to the avatars, they have some old models we can use or even create new ones with their animators
- no preference given to 3d or 2d, whichever is more realistic, faster, and doable.
- Nazim will provide us with a premium Kukarella account for testing

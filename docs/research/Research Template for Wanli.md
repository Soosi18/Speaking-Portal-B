## Research Notes
This research is for animating still images.
### Basic Approches
1. Based on what I have searched on Google, there is a java package named java2D which is used to create animation from still images, however, after look into it, it's
   mainly about how to move the image from one postion to another position.
2. The results I get contains a way to use java to move the eyeball regarding to the mouse movement, I think this can be helpful to 
   animate the still image.
3. Through all the ways I found on Internet, the most common things is to get the dimension of the image then just like in PhotoShop, circle the specific part of the image
   And then add some code to move that selected part.
4. Also found a way to animate the still image using a funtion called WindowFocusChanged(), but it seems this way only works with Android devices.
### Difficult Points
1. There is no such direct way to move the image with importing some package, so many class might be needed to complete this one destination.
2. How to solve the problem to animate the still image without other data like video pieces.
3. The most difficult part is to met the time requirements, no matter what option we choose to move still image, adding animation to selected parts or using video clips
   as data to move the image, they will both take long time to complete the mission.
4. Even the speed problem is solved, it cannot be predicted that how many video clips or how many animation we need to make the avatars moves like a real human when 
   talking or listening.

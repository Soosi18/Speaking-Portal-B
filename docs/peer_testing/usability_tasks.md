## **User Group 1 - Task Scenario**

You are a middle school biology teacher who wants to create a animated video of a character explaining the concept of a Cell Wall. You want to show this video to your students so that they can learn about this concept in a fun and engaging manner. You have acquired the files containing the script and audio required to create the video already through Kukarella Text-to-Speech.

6. Answer the following questions about the animated video:

    - What are your thoughts on the animation quality? Does it appear to be smooth or clunky/choppy?

    - Did you think the character’s lip-sync/mouth movements were accurate? Do they line up with the audio/voice in the background?

    - What do you think about the character’s facial and body movements during the animation? Did you find them to be too frequent or negatively impacting your impression of the video?  

    - Comment on your overall satisfaction with the animated video with reference to the task scenario mentioned to you at the beginning. Would you be willing to show this video to your students?

The primary functions of the cell wall are to provide structural support and protection to the cell. It helps the cell maintain its shape, provides resistance to mechanical stress, and prevents the cell from bursting when it is exposed to high pressure. The cell wall also acts as a barrier, controlling the movement of substances in and out of the cell and protecting it from harmful external factors like pathogens or toxic chemicals.

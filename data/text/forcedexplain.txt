Forced alignment is a technique that matches words from a transcript with sounds from an audio recording. The goal is to figure out exactly when each word in the transcript was spoken in the recording. This information is useful for tasks like speech recognition, where we want to know what was said and when. To do forced alignment, we first train a computer program using lots of speech recordings and their corresponding transcripts. This program learns to recognize the sounds that make up each word. Next, when we apply forced alignment to a new audio recording, the program uses what it learned to figure out which sounds in the recording match up with which words in the transcript. Think of it like trying to match up the words of a song with the music that goes with it. The program uses its knowledge of the words and sounds to match them up as best it can. And just like with a song, sometimes it might not get every word matched up perfectly, but it usually gets close. Forced alignment is a helpful tool for speech and audio analysis, as it gives us a precise way to understand the timing of words and sounds in a recording.
